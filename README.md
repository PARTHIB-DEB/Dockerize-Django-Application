Containerization is just like cooking üßë‚Äçüç≥ - You gather all ingredients and put in the container . Before cooking , there were in distinct shape , size , color but after cooking its a whole meal ü•ó. Just like that , You create different services for your application , precisely **Full Stack Application** , and then you put those services in a docker container - it may be databases , backend servers , frontend server , cache servers , queueing systems etc. Each of them has their own host & port to show them to you but within docker , they are containerized , more definitely - **multi-containerized** (because unlike cooking , if you put all stuffs in a single container , the size of it will be so big that your tiny SSDs may not handle it and forget those servers to even run quickly üòÑ)

But how those containers communicate with each other - if we consider cooking , ingredients got assembled in a large pot over , but here we have **Networks** üö†.
By defeault when you are locally building the project with docker , the containers communicate and run within **default** network of type **bridge**. But that **may not work** , if you pull your docker project from docker hub and directly build and run that shit !

This tutorial cheatsheet is all about dockerizing a working django backend who throws REST APIS like spiderman's web to you and your frontend üï∏ . It doesn't tell you anything about django but mostly about the hosting process in docker .

For those who know nothing but nuts in docker , follow this tutorial - [link](https://docker-curriculum.com/)
